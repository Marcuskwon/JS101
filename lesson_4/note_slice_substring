difference betweein .substring(a, b) and .slice(a, b)

They both will return a string with (from index a to the end point b exlucidng b)

let a = 'abcd'

a.slice(1, 3) -> b, c
a.substring(1, 3) -> b,c

differnece
- if the first index is bigger,
    -> substring  it swaps them.
    -> slice return empty 
    
- if arguement is negative
    -> substring treats it as '0.
    -> slice treats it as length - index.
